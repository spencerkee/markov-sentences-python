# markov-sentences-python

This program is my attempt at a simple, clean, well documented markov sentence generator that runs in Python 2 & 3. It makes a realisitc-seeming sentence using Markov chains created from a text file. The text "Metamorphosis" by Kafka is from Project Gutenberg with the copyright information removed so that it doesn't interfere with sentence creation.
